    I conduct applied research in <strong>quantitative finance</strong> and <strong>machine learning</strong>, with applications in trading, volatility forecasting, and portfolio optimization. I have worked with AI companies, hedge funds, and DeFi firms on systematic trading strategies, market microstructure, and derivatives pricing, and previously worked as a quantitative research engineer at Capital Group.
