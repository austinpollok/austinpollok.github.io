    I am Assistant Professor of Clinical Data Science and Operations and have a joint appointment in Finance and Business Economics at USC Marshall School of Business. I conduct applied research in quantitative finance and machine learning, with applications in trading, volatility forecasting, and portfolio optimization. I have worked with AI companies, hedge funds, and DeFi firms on systematic trading strategies, market microstructure, and derivatives pricing, and previously worked as a quantitative research engineer at Capital Group.
